== Customizing MantisBT

[[admin.customize.strings]]
=== Strings / Translations

All strings used in MantisBT, including those defined in plugins, can be
customized or translated differently. This is achieved by overriding
them in the _Custom Strings File_ (`config/custom_strings_inc.php`),
which is automatically detected and included by MantisBT code.

Defining custom strings here provides a simple upgrade path, and avoids
having to re-do the changes when upgrading to the next release.

[NOTE]
====
The standard MantisBT language strings are sometimes reused in different
contexts. If you are planning to override some strings to meet your
specific requirements, make sure to analyze where they are used to
avoids unexpected issues.
====

Format

....
$s_CODE = STRING;
....

Where

* CODE = string code, as called by lang_get() function. Search in
lang/strings_english.txt for existing codes.
* STRING = string value / translation

[WARNING]
====
NEVER call _lang_get_current()_ from the `custom_strings_inc.php`, as
doing so will reset the active_language, causing the code to return
incorrect translations if the default language is different from
English. Always use the _$g_active_language_ global variable instead.

=== Custom Fields

[[admin.customize.customfields.overview]]
==== Overview

Different teams typically like to capture different information as users
report issues, in some cases, the data required is even different from
one project to another. Hence, MantisBT provides the ability for
managers and administrators to define custom fields as way to extend
MantisBT to deal with information that is specific to their teams or
their projects. The aim is for this to keep MantisBT native fields to a
minimum. Following are some facts about the implementation of custom
fields in MantisBT:

* Custom fields are defined system wide.
* Custom fields can be linked to multiple projects.
* The sequence of displaying custom fields can be different per project.
* Custom fields must be defined by users with access level
ADMINISTRATOR.
* Custom fields can be linked to projects by users with access level
MANAGER or above (by default, this can be configurable).
* Number of custom fields is not restricted.
* Users can define filters that include custom fields.
* Custom fields can be included in View Issues, Print Issues, and CSV
exports.
* Enumeration custom fields can have a set of static values or values
that are calculated dynamically based on a custom function.

[[admin.customize.customfields.definitions]]
==== Custom Field Definition

The definition of a custom field includes the following logical
attributes:

* Caption variable name. This value is supplied to the lang_get() API;
it is therefore mandatory to set this to a
https://www.php.net/language.variables.basics.php[valid PHP identifier]
(i.e. only letters, numbers and underscores; no spaces) if you intend to
translate the field label (see
link:#admin.customize.customfields.localize[Localizing Custom Field
Names]).
+
[NOTE]
====
If the specified variable is not found in the language files or in
`custom_strings_inc.php`, then it will be displayed as-is.
====
* Custom field type (string, numeric, float, enumeration, email,
checkbox, radio, list, multi-selection list, date).
+
Type 'string' is used for strings of up to 255 characters.
+
Type 'numeric' is used for numerical integer values.
+
Type 'float' is used for real (float / double) numbers.
+
Type 'enumeration' is used when a user selects one entry from a list.
The user interface for such type is a combo-box.
+
Type 'email' is used for storing email addresses.
+
Type 'checkbox' is like enumeration but the list is shown as checkboxes
and the user is allowed to tick more than one selection. The default
value and the possible value can contain multiple values like
'RED|YELLOW|BLUE' (without the single quote).
+
Type 'radio' is like enumeration but the list is shown as radio buttons
and the user is allowed to tick on of the options. The possible values
can be 'RED|YELLOW|BLUE', where the default value can be 'YELLOW'. Note
that the default value can't contain multiple values.
+
Type 'list' is like enumeration but the list is shown as a list box
where the user is only allowed to select one option. The possible values
can be 'RED|YELLOW|BLUE', where the default value can be 'YELLOW'. Note
that the default value can't contain multiple values.
+
Type 'multi-selection list' is like enumeration but the list is shown as
a list box where the user is allowed to select multiple options. The
possible values can be 'RED|YELLOW|BLUE', where the default value can be
'RED|BLUE'. Note that in this case the default value contains multiple
values.
+
Type 'date' is for date values. The default value can be empty, or
\{tomorrow}, \{yesterday}, \{next week}, \{last week}, \{+3 days}, \{-2
days}.
* Enumeration possible values (eg: RED|YELLOW|BLUE). Use the pipe ('|')
character to separate possible values for an enumeration. One of the
possible values can be an empty string. The set of possible values can
also be calculated at runtime. For example, "=versions" would
automatically resolve into all the versions defined for the current
project.
* Default value - see details above for a sample default value for each
type.
* Minimum/maximum length for the custom field value (use 0 to disable).
Note that these metrics are not really relevant to custom fields that
are based on an enumeration of possible values.
* Regular expression to use for validating user input (use
https://www.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php[PCRE
syntax]).
* Read Access level: Minimum access level for users to be able to see
the value of the custom field.
* Write Access level: Minimum access level for users to be able to edit
the value of the custom field.
* Display when reporting issues? - If this custom field should be shown
on the Report Issue page.
* Display when updating issues? - If this custom field should be shown
on the Update Issue page.
* Display when resolving issues? - If this custom field should be shown
when resolving an issue. For example, a "root cause" custom field would
make sense to set when resolving the issue.
* Display when closing issues? - If this custom field should be shown
when closing an issue.
* Required on Report - If this custom field is a mandatory field on the
Report Issue page.
* Required on Update - If this custom field is a mandatory field on the
Update Issue page.
* Required on Resolve - If this custom field is a mandatory field when
resolving an issue.
* Required on Close - If this custom field is a mandatory field when
closing an issue.

If the value of a custom field for a certain defect is not found, the
default value is assumed.

[[admin.customize.customfields.editing]]
==== Adding/Editing Custom Fields

* The logged in user needs $g_manage_custom_fields_threshold access
level.
* Select "Manage" from the main menu.
* Select "Manage Custom Fields" from the management menu.
* In case of edit, click on the name of an existing custom field to edit
its information.
* In case of adding a new one, enter the name of the new custom field
then click "New Custom Field".

[NOTE]
====
Added custom fields will not show up in any of the issues until the
added custom field is linked to the appropriate projects.
====

[[admin.customize.customfields.linking]]
==== Linking/Unlinking/Ordering Existing Custom Fields in Projects

* The logged in user needs to have access level that is greater than or
equal to $g_custom_field_link_threshold and $g_manage_project_threshold.
* Select "Manage" from the main menu.
* Select "Manage Projects".
* Select the name of the project to manage.
* Scroll down to the "Custom Fields" box.
* Select the field to add from the list, then click "Add This Existing
Custom Field".
* To change the order of the custom fields, edit the "Sequence" value
and click update. Custom fields with smaller values are displayed first.
* To unlink a custom field, click on "Remove" link next to the field.
Unlinking a custom field will not delete the values that are associated
with the issues for this field. These values are only deleted if the
custom field definition is removed (not unlinked!) from the database.
This is useful if you decide to re-link the custom field. These values
may also re-appear if issues are moved to another project which has this
field linked.

*Moving Issues.*

When an issue is moved from one project to another, custom fields that
are not defined for the new project are not deleted. These fields will
re-appear with their correct values if the issue is moved back to the
original project, or if these custom fields are linked to the new
project.

[[admin.customize.customfields.localize]]
==== Localizing Custom Field Names

It is possible to localize the custom fields' labels. This can be done
as follows:

[arabic]
. Define the custom field (see
link:#admin.customize.customfields.definitions[Custom Field
Definition]), keeping in mind that its name must be a
https://www.php.net/language.variables.basics.php[valid PHP identifier].
+
As an example, we will use _my_start_date_ for a custom field of type
"Date", storing the date when work on an issue was initiated.
. Set the localization strings
* In the MantisBT `config` directory, locate and edit
`custom_strings_inc.php` (see link:#admin.customize.strings[Strings /
Translations]), create it if it does not exist.
* Localize the custom field's label _my_start_date_ by adding the
following code
+
....
<?php
switch( $g_active_language ) {
    case 'french':
        $s_my_start_date = 'Date de dÃ©but';
        break;

    default:
        # Default language, as defined in config/config_inc.php
        # ($g_default_language, English in this case)
        $s_my_start_date = 'Start Date';
        break;
}
....

[NOTE]
====
Had we decided to use _start_date_ as the custom field's name, then it
would not have been necessary to modify `custom_strings_inc.php` (see
link:#admin.customize.strings[Strings / Translations]), since MantisBT
would have used the existing, already localized string from the standard
language files. To check for standard strings, inspect
`lang/strings_english.txt`.
====

[[admin.customize.customfields.defaults]]
==== Dynamic default values

[[admin.customize.customfields.defaults.date]]
===== Dynamic defaults for Date fields

Custom fields of type date can be defaulted to either specific or
relative dates. Typically, relative dates is the scenario that makes
sense in most of the cases.

The format for specific dates is an integer which indicates the number
of seconds since the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time[Unix Epoch]
(January 1 1970 00:00:00 UTC), which is the format consumed by the PHP
https://www.php.net/date[date()] method.

The relative scenario expects default values like \{tomorrow},
\{yesterday}, \{+2 days}, \{-3 days}, \{next week}, etc. The curly
brackets indicate that this is a logical value which is then evaluated
using the PHP https://www.php.net/strtotime[strtotime()] function.

[[admin.customize.customfields.dynamic]]
==== Dynamic values for Enumeration Custom Fields

As discussed earlier, one of the possible types of a custom field is
"enumeration". This type of custom field allows the user to select one
value from a provided list of possible values. The standard way of
defining such custom fields is to provide a '|' separated list of
possible values. However, this approach has two limitations: the list is
static, and the maximum length of the list must be no longer than 255
characters. Hence, the need for the ability to construct the list of
possible values dynamically.

[[admin.customize.customfields.dynamic.default]]
===== Dynamic possible values included by default

MantisBT ships with some dynamic possible values, these include the
following:

* =categories - a list of categories defined in the current project (or
the project to which the issue belongs).
* =versions - a list of all versions defined in the current project (or
the project to which the issue belongs).
* =future_versions - a list of all versions that belong to the current
project with released flag set to false.
* =released_versions - a list of all versions that belong to the current
project with released flag set to true.

[NOTE]
====
The '=' before the name of the dynamic list of options is used to tell
MantisBT that this is a dynamic list, rather than a static list with
just one option.
====

[[admin.customize.customfields.dynamic.custom]]
===== Defining Custom Dynamic Possible Values

If the user selects =versions, the actual custom function that is
executed is custom_function_*_enum_versions(). The reason why the
"enum_" is not included is to have a fixed prefix for all custom
functions used for this purpose and protect against users using custom
functions that were not intended for this purpose. For example, you
don't want the user to use custom_function_*_issue_delete_notify() which
may be overridden by the web master to delete associated data in other
databases.

Following is a sample custom function that is used to populate a field
with the categories belonging to the currently selected project:

....
# --------------------
# Construct an enumeration for all categories for the current project.
# The enumeration will be empty if current project is ALL PROJECTS.
# Enumerations format is: "abc|lmn|xyz"
# To use this in a custom field type "=categories" in the possible values field.
function custom_function_override_enum_categories() {
    $t_categories = category_get_all_rows( helper_get_current_project() );

    $t_enum = array();
    foreach( $t_categories as $t_category ) {
        $t_enum[] = $t_category['category'];
    }

    $t_possible_values = implode( '|', $t_enum );

    return $t_possible_values;
}
....

Notice the following:

* The custom function doesn't take any parameters.
* The custom function returns the possible values in the format (A|B|C).
* The custom function uses the current project.
* The custom function builds on top of the already existing APIs.

To define your own function \u201c=mine\u201d, you will have to define
it with the following signature:

....
# --------------------
# To use this in a custom field type "=mine" in the possible values field.
function custom_function_override_enum_mine() {
    $t_enum = array();

    :

    $t_possible_values = implode( '|', $t_enum );

    return $t_possible_values;
}
....

Notice "override" in the function name. This is because this method is
defined by the MantisBT administrator/webmaster and not part of the
MantisBT source. It is OK to override a method that doesn't exist.

As usual, when MantisBT is upgraded to future releases, the custom
functions will not be overwritten. The difference between the "default"
implementation and the "override" implementation is explained in more
details in the custom functions section.

[[admin.customize.enums]]
=== Enumerations

Enumerations are used in MantisBT to represent a set of possible values
for an attribute. Enumerations are used for access levels, severities,
priorities, project statuses, project view state, reproducibility,
resolution, ETA, and projection. MantisBT provides the administrator
with the flexibility of altering the values in these enumerations. The
rest of this topic explains how enumerations work, and then how they can
be customised.

*How do enumerations work?.*

`core/constant_inc.php` defines the constants that correspond to those
in the enumeration. These are useful to refer to these enumerations in
the configs and the code.

....
define( 'VIEWER', 10 );
define( 'REPORTER', 25 );
define( 'UPDATER',  40 );
define( 'DEVELOPER', 55 );
define( 'MANAGER', 70 );
define( 'ADMINISTRATOR', 90 );
....

`config_defaults_inc.php` includes the defaults for the enumerations.
The configuration options that are defaulted here are used in specifying
which enumerations are active and should be used in MantisBT.

....
$g_access_levels_enum_string =
    '10:viewer,25:reporter,40:updater,55:developer,70:manager,90:administrator';
....

[NOTE]
====
The strings included in the enumerations here are just for documentation
purposes, they are not actually shown to the user (due to the need for
localisation). Hence, if an entry in this enumeration is not found in
the corresponding localised string (i.e. 70:manager), then it will be
printed to the user as @70@.
====

The Language Files (e.g. `lang/strings_german.txt`) provide the
localised strings (German in this case) for enumerations. But again, the
_master list_ is the enumeration in the configs themselves, the ones in
the language files are just used for finding the localised equivalent
for an entry. Hence, if a user changes the config to have only two types
of users developers and administrators, then only those will be prompted
to the users even if the enumerations in the language files still
includes the full list.

....
$s_access_levels_enum_string =
    '10:Betrachter,25:Reporter,40:Updater,55:Entwickler,70:Manager,90:Administrator';
....

*How can they be customised?.*

Let say we want to remove access level "Updater" and add access level
"Senior Developer".

The file `config/custom_constants_inc.php` is supported for the
exclusive purpose of allowing administrators to define their own
constants while maintaining a simple upgrade path for future releases of
MantisBT. Note that this file is not distributed with MantisBT and you
will need to create it if you need such customisation. In our example,
we need to define a constant for the new access level.

....
define( 'SENIOR_DEVELOPER', 60 );
....

In `config/config_inc.php`

....
// Remove Updater and add Senior Developer
$g_access_levels_enum_string =
    '10:viewer,25:reporter,55:developer,60:senior_developer,70:manager,90:administrator';

// Give access to Senior developers to create/delete custom field.
$g_manage_custom_fields_threshold = SENIOR_DEVELOPER;
....

Update `custom_strings_inc.php` (see
link:#admin.customize.strings[Strings / Translations])

....
$s_access_levels_enum_string =
    '10:Betrachter,25:Reporter,40:Updater,55:Entwickler,60:Senior Developer,70:Manager,90:Administrator';
....

[NOTE]
====
We don't need to remove the _Updater_ entry from the localisation file
if the current language is 'English'.
====

*Conclusion.*

We have covered how enumerations work in general, and how to customise
one of them. If you are interested in customising other enumerations, a
good starting point would be to go to _MantisBT Enum Strings_ section in
`config_defaults_inc.php`. This section defines all enumerations that
are used by MantisBT.

[[admin.customize.email]]
=== Email Notifications

See link:#admin.config.email[???] in the Configuration section.

Examples:

* Notify only managers of new issues.
+
....
$g_notify_flags['new'] = array(
    'threshold_min' => MANAGER,
    'threshold_max' => MANAGER,
);
....
* Notify Developers and managers of all project events, except, exclude
developers from the 'closed' events.
+
....
$g_default_notify_flags = array(
    'threshold_min' => DEVELOPER,
    'threshold_max' => MANAGER,
);
$g_notify_flags['closed'] = array(
    'threshold_min' => MANAGER,
    'threshold_max' => MANAGER,
);
....
* Exclude those who contributed issue notes from getting messages about
other changes in the issue.
+
....
$g_default_notify_flags['bugnotes'] = OFF;
....
* Exclude those monitoring issues from seeing the 'closed' message
+
....
$g_notify_flags['closed']['monitor'] = OFF;
....
* Only notify developers when issue notes are added.
+
....
$g_notify_flags['bugnote'] = array(
    'threshold_min' => DEVELOPER,
    'threshold_max' => DEVELOPER,
);
....
* Notify managers of changes in sponsorship.
+
....
$g_notify_flags['sponsor'] = array(
    'threshold_min' => MANAGER,
    'threshold_max' => MANAGER,
);
....
* Notify originator and managers of changes in ownership ("Assigned
To:").
+
....
$g_notify_flags['owner'] = array(
    'threshold_min' => MANAGER,
    'threshold_max' => MANAGER,
    'reporter'      => ON,
);
....
* I'm paranoid about mail. Only send information on issues to those
involved in them. Don't send mail people already know about. Also send
new issue notifications to managers so they can screen them.
+
....
$g_email_receive_own = OFF;
$g_default_notify_flags = array(
    'reporter'      => ON,
    'handler'       => ON,
    'monitor'       => ON,
    'bugnotes'      => ON,
    'category'      => ON,
    'threshold_min' => NOBODY,
    'threshold_max' => NOBODY
);
$g_notify_flags['new'] = array(
    'threshold_min' => MANAGER,
    'threshold_max' => MANAGER,
);
....
* How do I send all messages to an email logger.
+
You will need to create a dummy user with the appropriate access level
for the notices you want to log. Once this user is added to projects,
they will receive mail using the appropriate rules.

[[admin.customize.status]]
=== Customizing Status Values

This section describes how to add a custom status.

[arabic]
. Define a constant to map the new status to.
+
In subfolder config, locate and edit file _custom_constants_inc.php_;
(create it if it does not exist)
+
....
<?php
    # Custom status code
    define( 'TESTING', 60 );
....
. Define the new status in the enumeration, as well as the corresponding
color code.
+
In subfolder config, edit your _config_inc.php_
+
....
# Revised enum string with new 'testing' status
$g_status_enum_string = '10:new,20:feedback,30:acknowledged,40:confirmed,50:assigned,60:testing,80:resolved,90:closed';

# Status color additions
$g_status_colors['testing'] = '#ACE7AE';
....
+
Note that the key in the $g_status_colors array must be equal to the
value defined for the new status code in $g_status_enum_string.
. Define the required translation strings for the new status, for each
language used in the installation.
* _s_status_enum_string_: status codes translation (refer to the
original language strings for standard values)
* _s_XXXX_bug_title_: title displayed in the change status page
* _s_XXXX_bug_button_: label for the submit button in the change status
page
* _s_email_notification_title_for_status_bug_XXXX_: title for
notification e-mails
+
where XXXX is the name of the new status as it was defined in
_g_status_enum_string_ above. If XXXX contains spaces, they should be
replaced by underscores in the language strings names (e.g. for
'35:pending user', use '$s_pending_user_bug_button')
+
In the `config` subfolder, locate and edit `custom_strings_inc.php` (see
link:#admin.customize.strings[Strings / Translations]), create it if it
does not exist
+
....
<?php
# Translation for Custom Status Code: testing
switch( $g_active_language ) {

    case 'french':
        $s_status_enum_string = '10:nouveau,20:commentaire,30:acceptÃ©,40:confirmÃ©,50:affectÃ©,60:Ã  tester,80:rÃ©solu,90:fermÃ©';

        $s_testing_bug_title = 'Mettre le bogue en test';
        $s_testing_bug_button = 'A tester';

        $s_email_notification_title_for_status_bug_testing = 'Le bogue suivant est prÃªt Ã  Ãªtre TESTE.';
        break;

    default: # english
        $s_status_enum_string = '10:new,20:feedback,30:acknowledged,40:confirmed,50:assigned,60:testing,80:resolved,90:closed';

        $s_testing_bug_title = 'Mark issue Ready for Testing';
        $s_testing_bug_button = 'Ready for Testing';

        $s_email_notification_title_for_status_bug_testing = 'The following issue is ready for TESTING.';
        break;
}
....
. Add the new status to the workflow as required.
+
This can either be done from the Manage Workflow Transitions page (see
link:#admin.lifecycle.workflow.transitions[???]) or by manually editing
_config_inc.php_ as per the example below:
+
....
$g_status_enum_workflow[NEW_]         ='30:acknowledged,20:feedback,40:confirmed,50:assigned,80:resolved';
$g_status_enum_workflow[FEEDBACK]     ='30:acknowledged,40:confirmed,50:assigned,80:resolved';
$g_status_enum_workflow[ACKNOWLEDGED] ='40:confirmed,20:feedback,50:assigned,80:resolved';
$g_status_enum_workflow[CONFIRMED]    ='50:assigned,20:feedback,30:acknowledged,80:resolved';
$g_status_enum_workflow[ASSIGNED]     ='60:testing,20:feedback,30:acknowledged,40:confirmed,80:resolved';
$g_status_enum_workflow[TESTING]      ='80:resolved,20:feedback,50:assigned';
$g_status_enum_workflow[RESOLVED]     ='90:closed,20:feedback,50:assigned';
$g_status_enum_workflow[CLOSED]       ='20:feedback,50:assigned';
....
. Check and update existing workflow configurations
+
If you do not perform this step and have existing workflow definitions,
it will not be possible to transition to and from your new status.
+
Go to the Workflow Transitions page (manage_config_workflow_page.php),
and update the workflow as appropriate. Make sure that you have picked
the correct Project in the selection list).
+
Hint: to identify whether you have any workflows that should be updated,
open the Manage Configuration Report page (adm_config_report.php) and
filter on 'All Users', [any] project and config option =
'status_enum_workflow'. All of the listed projects should be reviewed to
eventually include transitions to and from the newly added states.

[[admin.customize.customfuncs]]
=== Custom Functions

Custom functions are used to extend the functionality of MantisBT by
integrating user-written functions into the issue processing at
strategic places. This allows the system administrator to change the
functionality without touching MantisBT's core.

Default Custom Functions are defined in the API file
`core/custom_function_api.php` , and are named
_custom_function_default_descriptive_name_, where _descriptive_name_
describes the particular function. See
link:#admin.customize.customfuncs.defined[Default Custom Functions] for
a description of the specific functions.

User versions of these functions (overrides) are named like
_custom_function_override_descriptive_name_, and placed in a file called
`custom_functions_inc.php` that must be saved in MantisBT's config
directory. In normal processing, the system will look for override
functions and execute them instead of the provided default functions.

The simplest way to create a custom function is to copy the default one
from the api to your override file (`custom_functions_inc.php`), and
rename it (i.e. replacing 'default' by 'override'). The specific
functionality you need can then be coded into the override function.

[[admin.customize.customfuncs.defined]]

==== Example Custom Function Override

The following function is used to validate an issue before it is
resolved.

....
<?php

/**
 * Hook to validate Validate field settings before resolving
 * verify that the resolution is not set to OPEN
 * verify that the fixed in version is set (if versions of the product exist)
 */
function custom_function_override_issue_update_validate( $p_issue_id, $p_bug_data, $p_bugnote_text ) {
    if( $p_bug_data->status == RESOLVED ) {
        if( $p_bug_data->resolution == OPEN ) {
            error_parameters( 'the resolution cannot be open to resolve the issue' );
            trigger_error( ERROR_VALIDATE_FAILURE, ERROR );
        }
        $t_version_count = count( version_get_all_rows( $p_bug_data->project_id ) );
        if( ( $t_version_count > 0 ) && ( $p_bug_data->fixed_in_version == '' ) ) {
            error_parameters( 'fixed in version must be set to resolve the issue' );
            trigger_error( ERROR_VALIDATE_FAILURE, ERROR );
        }
    }
}

?>
....

The errors will also need to be defined, by modifying the following
files

* `custom_constants_inc.php`
+
....
define( 'ERROR_VALIDATE_FAILURE', 2000 );
....
* `custom_strings_inc.php` (see link:#admin.customize.strings[Strings /
Translations])
+
....
$MANTIS_ERROR['ERROR_VALIDATE_FAILURE'] = 'This change cannot be made because %s';
....
