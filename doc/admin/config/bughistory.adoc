== Bug History

Bug history is a feature where MantisBT tracks all modifications that
are made to bugs. These include everything starting from its creation,
till it is closed. For each change, the bug history will record the time
stamp, user who made the change, field that changed, old value, and new
value.

Independent of the these settings, MantisBT will always track the
changes to a bug and add them to its history.

$g_history_default_visible::
  Make the bug history visible by default. If this option is not
  enabled, then the user will have to click on the Bug History link to
  see the bug history. Default is ON.
$g_history_order::
  Show bug history entries in ascending or descending order. Default
  value is 'ASC'.
