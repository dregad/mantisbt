== Configuration Settings

$g_global_settings::
  This option contains the list of configuration options that are used
  to determine if it is allowed for a specific configuration option to
  be saved to or loaded from the database. Configuration options that
  are in the list are considered global only and hence are only
  configurable via the config_inc.php file and defaulted by
  config_defaults_inc.php file.
$g_public_config_names::
  This option contains a list of configuration options that can be
  queried via SOAP API.
