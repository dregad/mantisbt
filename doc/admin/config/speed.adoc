== Speed Optimisation

$g_compress_html::
  This option is used to enable buffering/compression of HTML output if
  the user's browser supports it. Default value is ON. This option will
  be ignored in the following scenarios:
  +
  * If php.ini has zlib.output_compression enabled.
  * If php.ini has output_handler set to a handler.
  * If PHP does not include the zlib extension (PHP 4.3.0 and later
  include zlib extension by default).
  +
  You can check the loaded modules in your PHP by running "php -m" on
  the command line, or by using php_info() command in a php script.
$g_use_persistent_connections::
  Use persistent database connections, setting this to ON will open the
  database once per connection, rather than once per page. There might
  be some scalability issues here and that is why it is defaulted to
  OFF.
